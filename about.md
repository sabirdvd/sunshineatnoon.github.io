### More Information
I am a terrible writer. I love English, I like to hear it, read it and speak it. But the primary goal for this blog is to serve as a memo for me, so the next time I want to fix some bugs I solved before, I don't have to go through the nesting search for answers again. Also, I'd like to see my own progress as time passes by. Thus, this little should be enough for me now.
