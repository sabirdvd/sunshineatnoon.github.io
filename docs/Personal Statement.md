Personal background
Why Research & Computer Science
In all stories, real or fake, my favorite role is always a scientist who immerses him/her in the field he/she is interested, such as John Nash in Beautiful Mind or Walter Bishop in Fringe. I consider these people to be lucky to find what they love and be able to spend all their time immersing themselves in it. When I was in high school, I was interested most in math because it brought both peace and excitement to me. I enjoyed the concentration when I immersed myself in math as well as the excitement when I learned new knowledge or solved difficult problems. I even got the third prize in the national high school mathematics competition and 147 points (full score is 150) in the College Entrance Examination. As a result, I chose computer science to be my major since it is one of the best applications of math that changes the world most dramatically.

Why computer vision (the importance of cv)
“A photo is worth more than a 1000 words”. This old saying shows how important vision is in our lives. Though young children can do detection and recognition without even thinking, it is a shame that computers cannot. Having a firm belief in the promising prospect of AI, I believe we must address the bottleneck of computer vision. This is the first reason I chose cv as my research direction. Another important reason is the impressive and huge breakthrough that deep learning brought to the world. Computer vision researchers have been struggled for centuries to find powerful features, but improvements were tiny during 2010 to 2012. I remembered how disappointed I was when I couldn’t find features that can separate a golden retriever from a blonde. The revival of deep learning brought a lot of surprise to the cv world. Yielding one impressive result after another. I also remembered how excited I was when I used deep features of objects to find their most similar neighbors. Based on two reasons illustrated above, I decided to choose computer vision, especially deep learning as my research direction.

Educational background & Research Experience
Undergraduate Education – basic knowledge
During my four-year undergraduate education in Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, I focused on learning basic knowledge about computer science such as database, network, operating systems and so on. My hard work on studying was paid by a three consecutive years of second prize scholarship of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. I also practiced my programming skills by solving problems on online judgement systems because solving these problems helped me to improve both my programming skills and my thinking ability. My two teammates and I got third prize in the Programming Competition of BUPT in the year 2011 and 2012. 
Graduate Education - Research
Since I decided to choose computer vision as my research direction, I paid more attention to learn and apply specific knowledge about computer vision. I would like to talk about two most important research experiences.
