title: How to use Scrapy to scrape Amazon.com and save to sqlite
published: true

I am currently working on a project, which needs some backpack images and information. After spending some time googling, I found a handy tool called [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/)--a python module which helps me crawl Amazon.com easily and neatly. In this posts, I want to write down how I implemented this. Since I am a newbie in Scrapy, please feel free to point out my mistakes. Thanks.
